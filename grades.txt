1.Working with the Algorithms
- Data pre-processing (usage of lat/long and price & address missing values & conversion of data) (2/2)
- Apply k-means++ (1/1) 
- Apply hierarchical (1/1) 
- Apply GMM (1/1)
- Determination of parameters based on methodology (2/2)
- Explanation of data representation and parameters (1/1) 
- Provide a few bullet points with pros/cons of each algo (3/3)

2.Data visualization
- Heatmap creation (0.5/0.5)
- Explanation if heatmap is useful (0.5/0.5) 
- Cluster visualization for k-means++, hierarchical and GMM (1/2): doesn't plot hierarchical or GMM
- Report of average for each cluster (1/2): doesn't report clusters for hierarchical or GMM
- Plot on NYC map (Bonus points: 0) 
- Understanding of findings and real NYC conditions (0/1) << missing response >>

3.Image manipulation
- Load image (1/1)
- Process image (1/1)
- Apply kmeans on image pixels with features red, green, blue values (3/3)
- Replace pixels with the value of cluster centers (2/2)
- Project the image after clustering (1/1)
